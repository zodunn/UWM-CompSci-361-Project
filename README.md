**TA Scheduling Web Application â€“ Group Project Summary**

Our group developed a web-based TA scheduling application for the UWM Computer Science Department to streamline the current manual and email-based process of managing TA assignments. The application was built using Python and designed to support three user roles: Administrators (e.g., department chair), Instructors, and TAs.

The system allows administrators to create and manage user accounts, courses, and TA assignments. They can assign instructors and TAs to courses, designate TA responsibilities (such as grading or leading lab sections), and communicate with users via UWM email. Instructors can view their course and TA assignments, manage their own contact information, and assign TAs to specific lab sections. TAs can update their own contact information and view assignment details.

The application ensures that sensitive information such as phone numbers and home addresses is accessible only to administrators, while public contact information is available to all users. This solution replaces the outdated paper forms and email chains with a centralized, secure, and efficient platform for managing TA scheduling and communication.
